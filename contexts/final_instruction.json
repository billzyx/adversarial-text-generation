  "access_clarity": "**Task: Analyze the Speaker's Clarity**\n\n**Objective:** Evaluate the clarity of the speaker's description by assessing the ease of understanding the scene.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Break down the description into individual elements (actions, events, settings, characters).\n2. Identify any sentences or phrases that are:\n\t* Concise and specific (Text-like)\n\t* Vague or open-ended (Script-like)\n\t* Overly descriptive (novelistic)\n\t* Redundant or unnecessary\n3. Consider how these elements contribute to the overall clarity of the scene:\n\t* Do the individual elements cohere and flow smoothly, or are there jarring transitions or abrupt shifts in focus?\n\t* Are important details (e.g. the overflowing sink, the curtains blowing) given adequate attention, or do some elements feel secondary or minor?\n\t* Is the description easy to visualize and imagine, or are some elements confusing or unclear?\n4. Use your observations from steps 1-3 to conclude whether the speaker's clarity is more akin to Text or Script. Be sure to support your reasoning with specific examples from the description.",
  "access_attention_to_detail": "**Assessment Task: Speaker's Attention to Detail**\n\nRead the descriptive passage carefully and analyze the speaker's attention to detail. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the specific details mentioned in the passage, focusing on the minor elements such as object positions, character actions, and surroundings.\n2. Categorize the types of details mentioned, such as:\n\t* Environmental details (e.g., wind, curtains, water overflowing)\n\t* Character actions (e.g., cookie-stealing, stool overturning, mother drying dishes)\n\t* Object positions and arrangements (e.g., stool falling, cookies in the jar)\n\t* Character requests (e.g., little girl asking boy to be quiet)\n3. Consider the level of precision used to describe each detail. For example, the passage notes specific aspects such as the sink overflowing, but does not describe the temperature or humidity of the environment.\n4. Evaluate how the speaker's attention to detail impacts the overall picture painted by the passage. For example, the detailed descriptions of character actions and surroundings create a vivid scene, but the mother's inattention to the overflow suggests that her priorities are elsewhere.\n5. Based on these findings, conclude how the speaker's attention to detail affects the passage's overall effect. Is the level of detail meticulous and thorough, or does it prioritize some elements over others? What is the likely effect of the speaker's focus on detail on the reader?",
  "access_language": "Please analyze the given description to identify the speaker's language by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the vocabulary used in the description, paying attention to the complexity and specificity of the words chosen.\n2. Examine the sentence structures used in the description, noting whether they are simple, compound, or complex.\n3. Consider the level of detail provided, including both physical actions and environmental conditions.\n4. Evaluate the tone of the description, is it neutral, anxious, playful or distracted?\n5. Look for colloquial expressions, idioms, and contractions used in the description.\n6. Note the level of sensory details included, such as the feeling of wet feet, sound of the water, smell of fresh-baked cookies.\n7. Assess whether the language used is objective, third-person narrative or if it has a more subjective tone.\n\nUsing these steps, conclude by determining whether the speaker's language can be characterized as formal, informal, simple, complex, casual, vivid, general, specific, direct, colloquial, descriptive, or conversational. Provide specific examples from the description to support your analysis.",
  "access_focus": "Analyze the scene description provided and identify the speaker's focus by following these steps: 1) Identify the key elements present in the scene, such as characters, objects, actions, and settings. 2) Determine which elements are most prominent or take center stage. 3) Consider how these elements interact with each other and the overall atmosphere of the scene. 4) Think about what aspects of the scene are highlighted and which are relegated to the background. 5) Based on your analysis, determine what aspect of the scene the speaker seems to be emphasizing, such as the chaos caused by the stool and cookies, the mother's work at the sink, or the outdoor environment beyond the window. Write a clear conclusion explaining your determination of the speaker's focus, supported by your reasoning from steps 1-4.",
  "access_description_of_scene": "Please analyze the speaker's description of the scene by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the main elements of the scene, such as characters, objects, actions, and setting.\n2. Categorize each element into one of the following categories: setting, character action, character state, physical object, or atmospheric detail.\n3. Evaluate the level of detail provided for each category, using the following criteria:\n\t* Level 1: Bare essentials (e.g., only essential characters, objects, and setting)\n\t* Level 2: Detailed and specific (e.g., precise descriptions of characters' clothing, characters' positions)\n\t* Level 3: Rich and immersive (e.g., sensory details, figurative language)\n4. Consider how these categories and levels of detail work together to create an overall impression of the scene, taking into account:\n\t* How effectively the scene establishes the setting, characters, and their relationships\n\t* How vivid and immersive the description is\n\t* Whether the description creates tension, atmosphere, or mood\n5. In your conclusion, explain which level of detail the speaker's description aims for and why. For example, do they prioritize action and events, character traits and emotions, or atmospheric and setting details? Does the speaker achieve a balance among these elements, or is there an area where the description could be expanded or condensed for greater effect?"
