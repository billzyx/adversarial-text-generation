What a chaotic scene you've set! Let me summarize it for you:

**Setting:** The kitchen of a household

**Characters:**

* Mother: drying dishes at the sink
* Girl: asking for a cookie and trying to keep it a secret by telling the boy to be quiet
* Boy: taking cookies from the cookie jar and currently holding one out to the girl
* Stool: falling over due to being unstable

**Actions:**

* The water from the overflowing sink is running over the edge and onto the floor
* The curtains are blowing gently in the breeze outside (open window)
* The girl is reaching for a cookie with her hand and, simultaneously, is telling the boy to be quiet with her other hand
* The boy is falling off the stool as it tips over
* The mother is wiping dishes at the sink, standing in the growing water

**Description of environment:**

* Water overflowing from the sink, potentially making the floor slippery
* Wind blowing gently outside, with no indication of strong gusts or inclement weather
* Summer breeze allows for the curtains to billow and blow open, revealing the exterior scene
* Plate and cup drying area on the counter
* Outside, it appears to be daytime, but there's no visible activity other than a casual path through the bushes and potentially some movement behind the curtain of the adjacent window (assuming that's the correct assumption about the cupboard being in a adjacent room)
* Tree(s) and/or other landscaping are likely, given the mention of "tree" and
